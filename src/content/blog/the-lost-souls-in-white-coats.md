In the dimly lit corridors of our nation’s hospitals, the heartbeat of a nation seems to fade away. Our healing sanctuaries, once a ray of hope, have become the echo of despair and pain; The Pain of serving others, and the despair of own security.

The gravity of the situation weighed heavily on me when my close friend, a dedicated intern, recounted a distressing incident. He was subjected to physical assault so severe that it led to him losing consciousness while he was attending to a patient. Repeated phone calls from the so-called ‘Higher Authority’ compelling him to end the sensible issue and even threaten his life, it’s how we’re treated. I couldn’t help him but could feel the pain he was suffering. In a nation where healthcare should be a fundamental right, we find ourselves grappling with a stark truth: patients at hospitals but doctors at airports.

It’s understandable that grief often clouds the judgment of those who have lost their loved ones. The pain of losing a family member is a burden no one should bear, and emotions run high in such tiring times. However, it’s essential to remember that resorting to violence, whether physical or verbal, is never the answer. Our doctors are already working under tremendous pressure, facing life-and-death decisions daily. They need our support, not our anger.

To those who might have political connections or alliances with powerful figures, I urge you to pause and reflect. Even if you hold sway in the corridors of power, remember that when doctors become scarce, the health of the entire nation is at risk. In the face of the health crisis, no amount of political maneuvering can guarantee your safety or the safety of your loved ones. To those who resort to aggression, I ask: is this the way of reaction our culture taught us? Is this the legacy we wish to leave for our child? Are we so blinded by anger that we forget our shared humanity? It’s disheartening to see our society descending into a place where compassion is replaced by violence, and intellect seems to be in short supply.

In conclusion, let us remember that doctors are not our adversaries; they are our unsung heroes, working tirelessly to preserve the gift of life. Instead of pointing fingers, let’s unite to address the shortcomings in our healthcare system. Let us offer our unwavering support to the medical professionals who have dedicated their lives to our well-being. Only through empathy, understanding, and collective effort can we hope to restore the dignity of our hospitals and secure a healthier, brighter future for all of Nepal.
